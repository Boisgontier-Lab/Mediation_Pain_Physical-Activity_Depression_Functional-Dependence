# Depressive Symptoms and Physical Activity Mediate the Effect of Pain on ADL and IADL Functional Independence in Adults with Arthritis

This repo contains the `R` scripts to analyze the relationship between pain, depressive symptoms, physical activity, and functional status in adults with arthritis using the [CLSA](https://www.clsa-elcv.ca) panel data survey.

## Data
The scripts expect CSV files that are subsequently imported by `R`.
We cannot redistribute data files as per CLSA policy.
However, the [data](https://www.clsa-elcv.ca/data-availability/) are available to approved public sector researchers in Canada and elsewhere, with no preferential or exclusive access for any individual.

## Upload
For the mediation analysis, we use PROCESS script that should be [downloaded](https://www.processmacro.org/download.html) and run in `R`.
